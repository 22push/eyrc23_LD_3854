# e-yantra Lumnisity Drone
The e-Yantra Robotics Competition (eYRC) is a unique annual competition designed for undergraduate students in Engineering, Science, and Polytechnic colleges. This theme comprises two knockout stages and a total of six different tasks. Stage 1 is simulation-based, while Stage 2 involves hardware provided by e-YRC IIT Bombay.
