# e-yantra Lumnisity Drone
The e-Yantra Robotics Competition (eYRC) is a unique annual competition designed for undergraduate students in Engineering, Science, and Polytechnic colleges. This theme comprises two knockout stages and a total of six different tasks. Stage 1 is simulation-based, while Stage 2 involves hardware provided by e-YRC IIT Bombay.

## About Theme: Lumnisity Drone

## Task 0:-
Software installation:-
- Ubuntu 20.04
- ROS
- Python
## Task 1:-
### Part A:
- To build a PID control system to stabilise the Swift Drone at any given position in a simulation environment in Gazebo.
### Part B:
- To detect the no. of LEDs in a given image and find the centroid coordinates and area of each LED.
## Task 2:-
### Part A:
- Fly the Swift drone through a list of set points in the simulation environment in Gazebo. 
### Part B:
- Fly the Swift drone over the surface of an exoplanet and identify the organisms present in the simulation environment in Gazebo.
### Part C(Bonus):
- Fly the Swift drone over the surface of the exoplanet and identify the organisms present at different set points in the simulation environment in Gazebo.
## Task 3:-
- Hardware setup and testing.
## Task 4:-
### Part A:
- This task is our first hardware task where we have to build a PID control system that stabilise the Swift Drone at any given position in a real world.

### Part B:
- In this we have to make an algorithm that detect the clusters in the below images and find their centriod.

## Task 5:-
### Part A: 
- Create an algorithm for waypoint navigation. The drone must visit all given points within a limited time and land at a specified point.
#### [Task 5A Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WdsDhuPSoM)
### Part B:
- Identify an organism (only one) on the surface of the exoplanet and report its location.
#### [Task 5B Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnHkTyDyjhY)
### Part C(Practice task):
- Identify an organism (any number) on the surface of the exoplanet and report its location.
#### [Task 5C Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=48MemMvd2pQ)
## Task 6:-
- This was a final task consisting of two subtasks: the original task and a bonus task.
### Original Task:
- Similar to Task 5 Bonus part, but with the addition of a beep sound and LED blink according to the organism type. This time, the drone's starting and landing positions are fixed, so all takeoff and landing rules must be followed.

### Bonus Task:
- Similar to the original task, but the organisms can be at any location.
